# [Different xkcd](https://akim8.github.io/different-xkcd)

### What is this?

Nothing much. Just another way to read [xkcd](https://xkcd.com).

### Why make this?

I didn't find the original website very mobile friendly.

### The original website is better than this one.

The point of this isn't to be better, just different.

### How do I jump to a specific comic?

Add a hash and the number of the comic you want to the URL. For instance, if I want to get xkcd 147, my url would be https://akim8.github.io/different-xkcd#147.
