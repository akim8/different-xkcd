# [Different xkcd](https://kim4a.github.io/different-xkcd)

### What is this?

Nothing much. Just another way to read [xkcd](https://xkcd.com).

### There's already a website to read them from. Why make this?

I didn't find the original website very mobile friendly. Bite me.

### The original website is better than this one.

The point of this isn't to be better, just different.

### You're taking the author's work!

What? Nobody even uses this thing but me. Also, have you read XKCD's license yet?
